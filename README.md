# Shadowdark Parser

This tool takes the default shadowdark statblock format and converts the monster into JSON. It is pretty flexible in parsing, in that:

- It doesn't require blank lines between monster traits
- It can handle monsters with no descriptions
- It can handle monsters with variable/multiple levels (like the hydra, or elementals)
- It can handle monsters complex monsters like the ten-eyed oracle & the tarrasque

## Usage

1. Run `npm install shadowdark-parser`
2. Use it in your code:

```js
const shadowdarkParser = require('shadowdark-parser');
const stingbat = shadowdarkParser.parseStatblock(`
STINGBAT
Darting, orange insect-bat with
four wings and needlelike beak.
AC 12, HP 4, ATK 1 beak +2 (1d4 +
blood drain), MV near (fly), S -2,
D +2, C +0, I -2, W +0, Ch -2, AL N,
LV 1

DC 9 STR on turn to remove.
`);

// ...
```
